As an active user on social media and a person who love music, I hope there is a recommendation website app which can recommend music I may like. This app can search similar music according to data from my other social medias (i.e. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram). For example, it can record musicians who I recently follow on instagram. It also can record my music habit which may contains at what time I often listen to music and willing to explore relevant topics on social medias so that it can better notice me at a correct time. In addition, the same recommendation should not bother me again if I show no interest at them.
