ideas for team project.


idea 1:

Music App

A music app which help user searching music video for all musics in the playlist. Users could login with twitter or facebook, and we are going to collect their profile information. Our app will recommend songs by singers they followed. We are going to include music API or video API in our project.



idea 2:

Travel plan recommendation

The users only need to input the departure date, location and target site. Then the app will recommend the tickets(flight, train, bus, or driving route), hotel, and travel plans. Users could login with facebook and twitter, and we will collect the profile. We will recommend the travel plan related to what they're most interested in by collect their posts' topic from third-party. We will also use climate API to give them travel suggestion, for example remind users to bring umbrella if their target site is going to rain.
