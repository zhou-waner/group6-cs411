**About the Teammembers**

So the things happened among the group members are quite awkward. At the beginning of this semester, Jiachen consistently missed the discussion section. She explained she had an appointment with her advisor or professor, and this reason was used for 3 weeks in a row. Since we never discussed with all group members, someone suggested to meet on weekend. Jiachen refused to join ahain, then the rest of group members gathered up in Felix's place in a Sunday afternoon. We together choose the theme and the user cases. After that meeting, Jiachen finally appeared in the discussion and we met her in person.

Few weeks passed and we never thought that would be our last talk. Since the COVID-19, we cannot meet weekly and the whatsapp group remain silience from that time. There's a presentation to report the progress of each team. Beefore that we try connect all team members in whatsapp group but failed.Then two of us (Tengzi Zhao and Waner Zhou) finished the report. 

After that week, Felix showed up in the chat group. Everyone agree to have a meeting but we didn't had one for Felix dissapeared again. Then in the last week of class, Felix told us his WhatsApp just failed to notify him and he assume we will all choose to credit this course. Then when we want to havea meeting, he started to disappear again and didn't shown in our zoom meeting. Later Jiachen decided to quit this group and finish all by herself. She told us she would work alone.
